# Clover-Reader

![Alt text](snippet.gif?raw=true)

## Overview
CloverReader is my attempt at creating my own 4chan reading Android app. I wanted to create such an app despite the fact that many out there exists is because I don't like the ones out there. However, due to time constraints from other projects, I was not able to complete this app. I've learned a ton while creating app and I don't consider the time spent on this project wasted.

## What I've learned
First, I learned how to write a JSON wrapper for the 4chan API in Java. I had never written a wrapper before in any language as I always simply used someone else's implementation. This was a great learning experience and this is what took up the bulk of my time. Second, I've learned how to better manage/handle networking in Android using Asynctask. Networking is a big part of writting this app so I made it a goal to use only native Android functionalities to handle this. I believe I learned more about networking in Android this way. For my next project, I will probably be using outside libraries as needed. Third, I learned how to integrate existing libraries into an Android app. I used Glide to load the pictures from 4chan's cdn. I only used Glide because it was the first search result on StartPage and it seems to be widely used. Lastly, I think I've gotten much much better at debugging. Most of my projects since high school have been pretty small and thus haven't required much debugging. Making Android apps requires using a bunch of interconnected pieces such that a lot of bugs are going to creep in.

## Improvements
As always, there are improvements that can be done to improve this project and that I might integrate into another one. First, the UI needs a lot of work. Adding pagination to the list of threads in a board would be a great step towards making the app production level. Second, a lot of networking-related work needs to be done such as caching and faster load times. A lot of the app takes a lot of time to load. Third, adding settings to the app so that users can easily change a theme or not display NSFW threads/pics. Lastly, a lot of unit testing needs to be done in order for this app to work correctly. At the beginning, I tried to do unit testing for each model in the wrapper but then I kind of rushed through the project in order to get most of it done. More generally, the app still crashes in some places and this would be fixed by using unit testing.
